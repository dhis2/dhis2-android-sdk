# APK distributin { #android_sdk_apk_distribution }
The web app [APK distribution](https://apps.dhis2.org/app/dff273fc-909e-48af-b151-c4d7e9c8a12c) is used to determine the APK that must be used by the Android app. It is a way to control the version of the Android apps.

This parameter is automatically used by the official Android Capture app, which will offer the update when a new version is identified. Other custom applications might use this parameter to control their own updates. This logic must be implemented at application level.

Check more information about the app in the [docs](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/apk-distribution.html).
