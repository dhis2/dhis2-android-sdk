# Use case configuration { #android_sdk_use_cases }
The web app [Use Case Configuratin](https://apps.dhis2.org/app/7df6f344-0487-469c-abe6-53c6e729abcf) is used to assign use cases to programs/dataSets. This information can be used by the app in order to display the information using a different layout or to apply different business logic.

The SDK downloads the information generated by this app and exposes it in the UseCaseModule. The particular use case logic or UI must be implemented at application level.

Check more information about the app in the [docs](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/use-case-configuration.html).
